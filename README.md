## Explain the functionality of the project
This C# code creates a simple Pizza Order application. The user can choose the size (small, medium, large) of the pizza, select toppings (extra cheese, onion, mushrooms, olives, tomatoes, green peppers), crust type (thin or thick), and where they want to eat it (eat in or take out). The application calculates the total price based on the user's selections and displays it on the screen. The user can also reset the form to start a new order.
